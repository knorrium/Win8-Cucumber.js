Cucumber.js for JavaScript-based Windows 8 apps
===============================================

This is a version of [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) adapted for use inside
a Windows 8 store application.

In addition to the modified Cucumber.js (License](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/master/LICENSE)),
this repository also includes some step definitions for some basic functionality like navigation,
file open pickers (mocked, because invoking the real deal would stop the app in its tracks) and 
message dialogs.

Pull requests with more step definitions are welcome.
